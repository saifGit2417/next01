below topic we covered while learning from code evolution

1-routing

2-nested routing

3-dynamic routes

4-nested dynamic routes

5-catch all segments . creating slug route [...slug] > docs / after docs whatever you write you can access it as route
optional catch all segments , [[...slug]]

6-create private folders not available as routes > _lib > start folder name with '_' to make it private

7-route grouping (auth) > for ex creating auth folder to mov login , signUp/register , forgot-password to group in code base

create auth folder name wrapped inside () so while making file based route it will not considered as route
{auth}/register|login|forgotPassword
